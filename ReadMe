Galaxy.Info is a solar system educational app which was built using .Xaml and C# on the Visual Studio 2017 Xamarin Architecture.

It uses many different pages to accomplish its goal.

1. Main Page - This page holds buttons that you can click to go to the certain page you want to. eg.Saturn
The main page is based off a simple to use IOS home kind of look. 
I liked the idea of using big buttons for the users to go into each planet page.
There is also a Added EntryBox and Button for Setting your Name on the top Label of the Main Page.

2. Planet Pages.
-Using mainly Labels,Images and Buttons I made each page hold it's respective Information on it's planet along with a button to view more
information on a WikiPedia Page associated with the Planet you are currently clicked into.

3. More Page
This Page Holds Information on the Sun,Moon,Asteroids and Black Holes as they are very common to wander about and play a big part in our 
solar system.

All Images and Websites in the application were not created by me and were being used in this application for educational and learning purposes.
If you find these Images and wish to show support, I encourage you to do so. 

This Project was made for my Second Year First Semester Internet and Mobile Applications Class in GMIT Software Development Course.
